# Connect 4 on Zybo-Z7

This repository contains the code for a Connect 4 game developed on a Zybo-Z7 board. The game is played on a 7x6 grid, and the objective is to be the first player to get four of your pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

The game ends when the board is full or when one player has four pieces in a row. The player with the most pieces in a row at the end of the game wins.
